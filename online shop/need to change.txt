1. Change database config in db.php

2. Change database name in:
	cart/data.php
	include/admin/header.php
	include/home/header.php

	ex. select * from petshop.order;
	change it to: select * from databasename.order
	
	reason: in my situation, there is an error if you dont put the databasename before the table.

Note: You can find sql file in database folder
